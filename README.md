## Tic Tac Toe game against AI

Simple javascript based tic tac toe game. Under the hood it uses naive minimax without AB pruning.

UI is somewhat react-redux-ish, but there are no listeneres so 'state management' happens in the UI part. UI is purely written in vanilla JS for the sake of simplicity.

It is bundled with webpack only to be able to write it in ES6 without any compatibilty issues.
